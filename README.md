# Tactical Map Switcher

**Tactical Map** is a Foundry VTT module that allows GMs to toggle between a normal scene and a tactical map on the active scene. It provides a seamless transition between the two.

It's a quality of life module, especially if you are running a Theather of the Mind game, but want to solve combats more tactically.

2. In the **Basics** tab locate the **Tactical Map** settings
3. Provide the path to your Tactical Map image in the **Tactical Map Image** field
4. Configure the grid type and size as needed, they can be different from the main scene, but will use the same color and line configuration
5. Optionally, check **Add Tokens to Encounter** if you want all scene tokens to be added to a combat encounter when the tactical map is activated
6. Save your scene

### Alternative token images

Put in the same folder of your token image one or two variants to be used with the tactical maps:

#### Top-down view: {token image}_tdv.ext
#### Isometric view: {token image}_isv.ext

If you don't have images for that map type don't worry, the main one will be used.

### Switching to the Tactical Map

#### 3. Click the button again to return to the original scene settings. The tokens will keep their positions on each map and if you add any new token to the scene they will initially be positioned at the margins of the other scene in case they fall out of range due to scene sizes.
